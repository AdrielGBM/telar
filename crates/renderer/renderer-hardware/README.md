# telar-renderer-hardware

wgpu-based GPU renderer for Telar with path tessellation, blur and compositing.

Part of [Telar](https://github.com/AdrielGBM/telar), a modular Rust UI framework with its own template
language, reactive signals and a self-contained renderer.

**Applications depend on the [`telar`](https://crates.io/crates/telar) facade, not on this crate.** Telar
is split into small crates so a build carries only the target and the capabilities it named, and every one
of them has to be published for the facade to be. The facade re-exports what an application needs behind
feature flags; reach for this crate directly only if you are writing a frontend or a tool against Telar's
internals.
